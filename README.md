# MIPS-Programs
This repository contains assembly level programs (MIPS). These programs were done for my university labs. 
Information of the individual programs are as below:
- **Program 1:** It will take in two arrays having same size as inputs and output a third array having same size which contains the least elements present in both the arrays.
- **Program 2:** It will take in an array as input and reverse it.
- **Program 3:** It will take in two floating numbers and output the sum of those two.
- **Program 4:** It will take in two numbers and print the multiples of those two numbers.
- **Program 5:** It will take in a row size as input and create a pyramid pattern with number of rows as given by the user.
- **Program 6:** This program takes an array as input and it will print the maximum element present in that array.
- **Program 7:** This program will take in two arrays of same size as input and it will output the array having the minimum sum of all the elements present in it.
- **Program 8:** This program will take in a string and output that string back to the user.
- **Program 9:** This program will take in an array and returns it back sorted.
- **Program 10:** This program will take in two floating values as input and it will return it back after swapping them.
- **Program 11:** This program will take in 3 items having two parameters each. The two parameter are the number of units sold and cost of a single unit. After this it will do all the computation and return the total amount of cost for all of the products.
- **Program 12:** This program will take a mark as input and it will return it's corresponding grade.
